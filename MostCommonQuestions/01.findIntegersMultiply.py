# Problem: "Find two integers that multiply to k"

# Example: 
#  [2,4,1,6,5,40,-1], 20 -> [4,5]

# Questions:
# 1. Are there duplicates? Yes
# 2. Are there negative numbers? Yes

# Brute-force solution:
# Check any possible pairs (O(NË†2))

# Approach:
# Use a set() (which is a hash), look back

# Complexity:
# O(N) time
# O(N) space

	visitedNumbers = set()

		if diff in visitedNumbers:
			return [diff, number]
		else:
			visitedNumbers.add(number)
	return None
